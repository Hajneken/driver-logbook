# Design

This directory contains UML diagrams describing the design of the project. It contains the following subdirectories:

* Initial: Initial plans for architecture at the beginning of the project
* final: Final design diagrams describing architecture of the completed project

## Layered Architecture

The project followed a layered architecture, with the following layers:
1. Presentation Layer
2. Application Layer
3. Domain Layer
4. Persistance Layer

This approach allows for a separation of concerns, and allows for the application to be easily extended and modified.

See the [architecture diagram](./final/layered-architecture.svg) for more visual representation.
