| Persisting Trip                  | when a new trip is in progress it is kept in memory until it is ended, after ending the trip each trip is persisted in local storage                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Pagination                       | trips are organized using sequence numbers, enabling storing trips as separate entities in the database resulting in better performance                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Chronological sort of trips      | sorted from the latest trip by default, this can be changed to sort from the oldest loaded trip                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Load More Trips                  | By default only 5 trips are loaded in Overview, if more trips are available 5 more can be loaded, until there are no more trips left                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Edit Existing Trip               | In admin mode, each field of the stored trip can be edited  (start location, end location, start odometer, end odometer, start time, end time) such that updated value is not in conflict with potential previous or next value. Each trip has a 3-dot button to access the updating menu.                     |
| Editing trip summary             | The final step in creating a new trip is displaying a summary of the trip's data. Each field, including the Start Location, End Location, Start Odometer, End Odometer, Start Time, and End Time, can be revised before confirming, ensuring that the updated value does not conflict with any previous trips. |
| Delete Existing Trip             | Each trip can be deleted from the local storage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Offline mode                     | App can be used without connection to the internet for viewing and editing functionalities, for creating trips the internet connection is required (guarding prompt is displayed)                                                                                                                              |
| Experimental Mode                | In this mode, the app selects the recognized value automatically, or if recognition fails, it attempts to select the value of the last trip, saving the user several steps when creating a trip.                                                                                                               |
| Demo Mode                        | Demo mode allows the user to test features of the app with mocked data (trips, locations and odometer values).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Debug Mode                       | For a developer the debug mode allows for logging capabilities (log latest trip, dump contents of database, purging database and restarting the app).                                                                                                                                                          |
